# character_creator

This was a solo project in CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

In this project I had to make a character creator application just in most of video games.
Of course with my recent knowledge I couldn't do animated and 3d character designs. So I used simple 2d static images.

There are 3 kind of selections with some gender, race and type, I made character's picture everchanging after every select action.

This project was made with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript (without using only and empty #root div)
